NotebookLM is a valuable tool for students and researchers due to its ability to help synthesize complex information, organize research materials, and generate various study aids.
Here's how a student or researcher can use NotebookLM:
1. Uploading and Managing Research Sources:
•
Diverse Source Types: Students and researchers can upload a variety of materials into a notebook, including Google Docs, Google Slides, PDF files, web URLs, copied text, YouTube URLs (for public videos with captions), and audio files.
•
Static Copies: When sources like Google Docs or PDFs are uploaded, NotebookLM creates a static copy. For Google Docs and Slides, you can manually re-sync if the original file changes, but other sources require re-uploading.
•
Source Limits: Each source can be up to 500,000 words or 200MB for local uploads, with no page limit. A single notebook can hold up to 50 sources, or 300 sources for NotebookLM Plus users.

Project Organization: Notebooks help organize projects separately, meaning information from one notebook cannot be accessed from another simultaneously.
2. Understanding and Interacting with Information:
•
Chat Interface: Users can interact with their uploaded sources by asking questions or providing instructions in a chat interface. NotebookLM will respond with answers grounded in the uploaded material, providing inline citations that link directly to the original passage in the source documents.
•
Controlled Sourcing: Users can select specific sources to be used by NotebookLM when generating a response.
•
Source Overviews: Automatically generated "Source Overviews" summarize documents and suggest key topics or questions to help better understand the material.
•
Beyond Factual Queries: NotebookLM is not limited to just factual questions; it can also assist with creative tasks, such as suggesting new characters for a story, new product features for a business plan, or titles/subtitles for a blog post.
•
Handling Ambiguity: If NotebookLM cannot answer a question, it might be due to safety flags, unclear phrasing (which can be improved by making questions more specific), or if the information is simply not present in the sources.
3. Generating and Transforming Content:
•
Studio Panel: The Studio panel on the right side of the workspace is used to generate various outputs grounded in your sources.
•
Reports/Summaries: NotebookLM can generate different content formats, including summaries, briefing documents, timelines, FAQs, and study guides.
◦
FAQ: Generates a list of frequently asked questions with answers from your sources.
◦
Study Guide: Converts source material into a short answer quiz with an answer key, suggested essay questions, and a glossary of key terms.
◦
Briefing Doc: Extracts key facts and insights in an outline format.
◦
Timeline: Creates a chronological list of major events and short bios of individuals mentioned in the sources.
•
Audio Overviews: These are "deep dive" discussions between two AI hosts that summarize key topics in your sources in a podcast-style conversation. Users can even interact with the audio overview in a beta interactive mode.
4. Note-Taking and Organization:
•
Multiple Note Creation Methods: Notes can be created by saving model responses, writing new notes, or by generating one-click summaries like Briefing Docs, Timelines, FAQs, and Study Guides directly from your notebook sources.
•
Note Limits: You can create up to 1000 notes per notebook.
•
Collaborative Notes: Notes can be edited in real-time by users who have "Editor" access to a shared notebook.
•
Converting Notes to Sources: All notes in a notebook can be converted into a new source document, providing a snapshot of the notes' content.
•
Brainstorming and Organizing Ideas: NotebookLM offers tools to organize and brainstorm ideas once a set of sources and quotations are collected. Users can quickly pin interesting ideas or quotes as notes on the noteboard.
5. Specific Research Workflows:
•
Academic Research: Ideal for synthesizing information from multiple documents for students, scholars, journalists, and analysts. Users can upload research materials (PDFs, Google Docs, web pages) and then ask questions or track down references.
•
Working with Books/E-books: It's recommended to capture important quotes from books and save them in a Google Doc, ideally with author, title, and page number metadata in each paragraph. This allows NotebookLM to answer factual questions and broader queries about authors or topics. Tools like Google Play e-reader and ReadWise can help export quotes to Google Docs optimized for NotebookLM.
•
Meeting/Interview Transcripts: Uploading transcripts (including audio files which NotebookLM transcribes) allows users to remember, summarize, and quickly find relevant passages. Filmmakers, podcast producers, or financial analysts can use it to ask open-ended questions about controversial quotes, specific mentions, or financial details across many transcripts. For best results, format transcripts with speaker names and time codes in each paragraph.
6. Collaboration and Sharing:
•
Sharing Options: Notebooks can be shared with others, granting either "Viewer" (read-only access to sources and notes) or "Editor" access (view, add, remove sources/notes, and further share).
